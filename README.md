# ðŸš— Fuel Consumption and CO2 Emission Analysis

## Overview
This project uses Python and machine learning libraries to analyze and predict CO2 emissions based on fuel consumption data. It includes both Simple and Multiple Linear Regression models.

## Key Features
- Utilizes `scikit-learn` for Linear Regression models.
- Employs datasets with car attributes like engine size, cylinders, and various fuel consumption metrics.
- Aims to predict CO2 emissions using car features.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python
- Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`

### Data Understanding
The `FuelConsumption.csv` dataset includes attributes such as:
- Model Year, Make, Model, Vehicle Class
- Engine Size, Cylinders, Fuel Consumption in City/Highway
- CO2 Emissions

### Analysis and Modeling
1. **Data Visualization**: Explore relationships between features like engine size and CO2 emissions.
2. **Train-Test Split**: Split the dataset for training and testing.
3. **Linear Regression Models**:
   - **Simple Linear Regression**: Predict emissions based on a single feature.
   - **Multiple Linear Regression**: Utilize multiple features for more accurate predictions.
4. **Evaluation**: Use metrics like Mean Squared Error and Variance Score to assess the models.

## Conclusion
This project illustrates the application of linear regression techniques in predicting environmental impact based on vehicle specifications.
